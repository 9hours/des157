            <h4>How will your users understand the content of the project?</h4>
            <p>Through exploration and curiousity. Although I'm considering of using a disclaimer alert message when the website loads.</p>

        <section>
            <h4>How will your users understand the primary objectives?</h4>
            <p>Through visual keys such as hover effects or timed events.</p>

        <section>
            <h4>What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</h4>
            <p>This will be a graphics based website, the only text are titles and description. My users will need clear graphics and text to help navigate them but also foster exploration through curiousity.</p>

        <section>
            <h4>How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are their experience levels with the type of media you are creating?</h4>
            <p>I think my users should keep an open mind with websites as they are evolving constantly. I believe their experience level with the type of media I'm creating is low concept-wise. I believe my users have had experiences in small doses in different
                websites. </p>
