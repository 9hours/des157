<h3>Bio creation and data</h3>
<p>Data is becoming pervasive in our daily lives. Scientists have used data and biological processes to create products and systems, while artists explore the aesthetics of technology, data and biology. How do artists integrate data and biological phenomenon in the creative process? In what ways do designers take advantage of large amounts of data to make decisions that affect sustainability and biodiversity?</p>

<h3>Media art, landscape and heritage</h3>
<p>ISEA2017 will take place in a region in Colombia known as the Coffee Cultural Landscape, declared as a world heritage site by UNESCO. We invite work that reflects on the conflict between media and heritage. How do artists and designers include heritage in their critical thinking and aesthetic decisions? How could media art help disseminate cultural values around peace? Does media art have the capacity to preserve heritage? Does conservation or cultural transformation generate conflict?</p>

<h3>Interdisciplinary platforms for coexistence</h3>
<p>Transdisciplinary teams collaborate to generate social and political content and debates. Artists, designers and scientists have tried to work together and get citizens involved with interactive technologies and media. Are these platforms showing paths for social coexistence? How transdisciplinary collaborations can generate social benefits? How can biological process be used as source of inspiration and the generation of social possibilities for living in peace?</p>
