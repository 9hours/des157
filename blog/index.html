                <h1>ENTRY 1 | INTERFACE</h1>
                <img src="images/01_tumblr_design.png" alt="tumblr app interface design">
                <p>The first thing that popped into my head was the app I use the most: the Tumblr app. I feel like my evaluation of the user interface might be skewed because of how accustomed I am with the icons and the site but that would contribute to
                    the effectiveness of the app/site.</p>

                <p>Overall, the app is simple in visual design. It does not overwhlem with too many unlabeled or new icons (TALKING ABOUT YOU SNAPCHAT). For example, it has a different format for showing different information (recommended blogs are horizontally
                    placed while already followed blogs scroll vertically). And if you want to follow a blog, you don't have to guess which icon because it spells the word out for you. </p>

                <p> Starting from the top highlighted box, there are two icons that should be familiar to most social media users: (from the left) the heart and the reblog button. The next two icons however might not be familiar (although this is the only
                    social media app besides Facebook). The speech bubble can be inferred as an icon that relates to talking to other users and that is true, however it's not a messaging system - the icon for that is at the bottom with a face. The arrow-looking
                    icon on the top highlighted box is the one that works together with the messaging system. The user can send the post through the messaging system to another user. Other than that, the rest of the icons are effective in showing what
                    it's meant to be used for.
